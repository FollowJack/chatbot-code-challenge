# Further Work

Improvements:

Structure
[] Atomic Design Pattern by Brad Frost

Styling
[] Styling encapsulate in separate files
[] better provide theming
[] Use tooltips for buttons that give further instructions
[] Have a time delay with a ... content as message from the bot to give the user the feeling of writing with a bot instead of instant displaying the message.

Logic
[] Further improve the performance of the custom hook. Simple 2 lists (one for ordered flow messages and one for the given answers by the user). Idea would be to melt this into on single structure.

Error Handling
[] Error handling could be in a separate file
[] Toast or other component used to display error message

Typescript
[] Further specify
[] Remove duplication

Custom hooks
[] fetching of data could be in a separate hook
